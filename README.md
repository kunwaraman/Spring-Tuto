## Introduction to Spring

Spring is a powerful, feature-rich framework for building Java applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing enterprise-level applications, simplifying Java development with its Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) capabilities.

## Spring Core

Learn about the core features of Spring, including IoC and DI.

- **Topics Covered:**
  - What is IoC and DI?
  - Configuration options (XML, annotations, Java-based)
  - Bean scopes and lifecycle
  - Spring container and BeanFactory vs. ApplicationContext

[Learn More](core/README.md)

## Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications.

- **Topics Covered:**
  - Creating a Spring Boot application
  - Spring Boot starters and dependencies
  - Configuration properties and profiles
  - Building RESTful web services with Spring Boot
